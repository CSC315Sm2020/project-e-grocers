E-Grocers
  
  We all have some experience of going to the grocery store as it is the necessity we cannot avoid as we all eat. During our visit we may have experienced problems like not being able to find the item location and looking around to find someone to help or going on every aisle looking for that specific item we have been looking for. With the help of a relational database we are trying to find out the better solution for the grocery store dilemma. By using E-Grocers customers can locate the item in the store which will help them in making their grocery experience better. Here customers are the end users who are able to view and take advantage of the database but other details are hidden from them which will be only available to the persons associated with the store.

Problem Statement: A major issue for small scale grocery stores such as Farmer’s Markets and ethnic supermarkets like an Indian grocery bazaar is the lack of a cohesive database system that serves different types of end users. In the case of big ticket stores like Target and Walmart, the officials behind the scenes have the resources to maintain a large database. However, with smaller, more local grocery stores, such databases aren’t as efficient nor advanced as they can be.

Module Objective: The objective is to create a database that provides a multitude of services for small grocery store employees and ordinary customers with their store experiences. This database should help the employees carry out their duties efficiently. At the same time, it should inform and support customers on product availability and whatever they intend to purchase.

End Product Description: The intended database system should help grocery store employees carry out their responsibilities as well as simplify the shopping experience of customers. The database should allow the store manager to dictate product prices and also be the most secure way to pay employees. The database most importantly should keep track of inventory which will be managed by the stock clerks. When inventory is low, the product buyer should be notified so that they can order more stock. For this purpose, we should also include the supplier in the database. The stock clerks should be able to update the database each time a change is made to the inventory. For example, whenever a purchase is made, the database automatically deducts from the inventory likewise if a new product arrives, it should be added to the inventory database.

End Product Importance: The importance of this end product is that it notifies both store employees and the customers on what is and isn’t available in store. This makes the store more organized and efficient when it comes to transactions. The database should also help customers with finding items in the physical store which is often a hassle in local grocery stores that fail to have large signs in aisles. Overall, the importance of this database is that it makes the grocery experience easier.

Research Plan: As a group, we intend to research different aspects of the grocery store world such as the product offerings, their prices, their quantities, as well as expected employee salaries. We intend to obtain the data we need by browsing through local farmer’s markets data and other ethnic grocery stores. If they exist, we will try to see the websites of other small grocery stores though this is rare. For example, we can compare product prices and understand how other small scale grocery stores present themselves. Perhaps a lot of this desired data can be achieved by visiting actual grocery businesses which maintain no websites/online presence but still have high demand. Likewise, we will also observe the work of large scale supermarkets and see how they appeal to customer satisfaction. Maybe if we implement the services of large supermarkets into local grocery stores, we can improve the demand for smaller businesses.We have basic idea of how the grocery store works and also one of the team member (Upendra) have worked for the local grocery store which will help us in gathering the data from their website.

Similar Systems: At the end of the day, E-Grocer is a management solution. Other noteworthy management solution software includes inFlow and zhenhub. inFlow, in particular, is able to manage products, customers, barcodes, costs, sales orders, purchase orders, and count sheets. Other Possible Applications: The other applications of the system could be employee time scheduling, that way not only the managers the employees can also be sure and take advantage of the system. Stores can start to have the membership management system, which will facilitate them by gathering important information about their sales and use those data for loss prevention and increased revenue generation.

Performance: Key aspects to how it will perform is how the staff use the program as well as how the customer will use it. To be efficient in managing inventory the way to do it would be to use hash tables so adding, removing, and searching for the item would be done instantly. There will be counters to keep track of all the different products and a floor number to notify when the supply is running low. In terms of how the customer will use it will be an online shopping cart that allows customers to add, remove, change item quantity, output descriptions, and take a look at how much is in the shopping cart so far. The features will only work in the product they add is the kind the store sells or in stock.

Security: First thing that comes to mind, we should encrypt any private information such as employee and customer information. Having an audit long would help out greatly, to see who changed what and when, so we can find the culprit of any unwarranted edits. Beyond this, each employee should have a different type of access to the database. The manager should have the ability to monitor the transactions and employee salary information. The lower level employees will not have the same access or functionalities.

Backup/Recovery: For back and recovery there will be a temporary storage that will store the current version of the database before any of the updates are made.

Technologies/Database Concepts: I think as per the instructions we need to learn about the python programming language in order to get basic UI and framework for the system, which we have come up to learn from resources like youtube and edx as a Crash course. Besides python we need to have the database concepts which i think we are learning little by little from our class, also we need to have the proper knowledge of querying techniques and proper design. We probably use MySQL.

Diagrammatic Representation: There is a high chance that as a group, we may have over planned our project meaning it simply might be too broad for us to accomplish. For example, as of now, we decided that the E-Grocers should help with inventory management, salary payments, administrative responsibilities (price updating), and online purchases. However, an online purchase feature is a very massive addition to the database. Perhaps, we can develop a subsystem where online purchases exist. Some data that we will model includes: Employee information, customer information, product information, (online) order information, supplier information, Some queries we can have: add_item & remove_item (for both customers & stock clerks), purchase_item, price_change, restock_product, view_price, product_location,
